The code is packed in a standalone Javascript bundle and is added to this repository for packaging as a Cordova plugin.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you are new to Mobile Apps, you can get started by following [Mobile Apps documentation](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-value-prop/).\n\n### Offline data sync\n\nOffline data sync is a feature of Azure Mobile Apps that makes it easy for developers to create apps that are functional without a network connection. Offline data sync is now available in the Cordova SDK. For detailed documentation, known issues and future work refer this [README](https://github.com/azure/azure-mobile-apps-js-client/tree/cordova-2.0.0).\n\n### Sample usage ###\nThe following code creates a new client object to access the *todolist* mobile apps backend and create a new proxy object for the *TodoItem* table.\n\n    var mobileAppsClient = new WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient(\n            \"https://todolist.azurewebsites.net\"\n        );\n\n    var todoTable = mobileAppsClient.getTable('TodoItem');\n    \n### Quickstart ###\nRefer [README.md](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-js-client/blob/cordova-2.0.0/README.md) for detailed quickstart instructions.\n\n## Need Help?\n\nBe sure to check out the Mobile Services [Developer Forum](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/azuremobile/) if you are having trouble.
